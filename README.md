Yet another Home Automation platform...

**Do we need another one of those?** No...

**Do I care?** No...

## Why?

'Then why even bother building one in the first
place when there are already systems like Home Assistant
being used globally?'

That's a good and valid question, but I don't really care.
This projects serves as big learning opportunity for me,
so I don't really care if you end up using it or not.

This will probably be WIP for a long time, so if you're brave
enough to eventually try it out, I wish you the best of luck.

## Design choices

I've worked with some platforms like Home Assistant and IPSymcon
in the past. So I'm probably going to steal a bunch of ideas from
them, no shame there really. Those are great systems on their own,
so no need to reinvent an open-source wheel.

Oh yeah, I'm writing this in Golang btw. Because Python's
performance at scale is shit in my opinion.
(Like why does it take 5 min to restart Home Assistant... It's not THAT complex...)
And I like Go...

## Issues?

If you end op finding any issues or features you would like
implemented. Go do it yourself, this ain't open-source just for fun, and I don't work for you. So be my guest and make your fork.
